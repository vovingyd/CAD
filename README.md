# Welcome to my CAD Portfolio!

In this repository, you will find a collection of 3D models and corresponding screenshots. Each folder contains both the STL models and the screenshots of the models.

To view the models, you will need a 3D modeling software such as AutoCAD or Blender. The STL files can be imported into these programs to view and manipulate the models.

The screenshots provide a preview of what the models look like, in case you do not have access to a 3D modeling software.

I hope you find these models useful! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me or open an issue.
